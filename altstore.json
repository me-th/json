While making sure everything is working perfectly and to my standards.\n\nThis source is updated 2-3 times a week, or more depending on the urgency. But I am working on automating updates through a python bot which I am close to completing.\n\nIf you enjoy my source please spread the word, this is essentially an updated QuarkSources, and I would like it to be as big, if not, bigger!\n\nTo make requests, get support or chat with other users, join the discord server! https://discord.gg/nKXsSdbEDc\n\nWuXu’s Sources Official Website: https://wuxu1.github.io/",

However this tweak may stop working in the near future as it is an old version.\n\n\n\nSpotify++ contants a tweak that activates Premium. As well as a number of tweaks to customise the UI and improve the overall user experience.\n\nHere are the following tweaks:\n\n• Spotilife - Premium for free.\n\n• Sposify - A Tweak to customize your Spotify App UI and expand functionalities.\n\n• Volify - Adds a volume slider to Spotify.\n\n• SpotifyAllowSetting - Allows you to access all of the settings in Spotify that are normally disabled when someone else is playing music from another device.\n\n• SpotifyNoPodcasts - Hides Podcasts from from Home and Library\n\n• SpotifyHighQuality - Enables 'Very High' Quality in Audio Quality settings\n\n•TrueShuffle - Enables true random shuffling (Spotify prioritizes Songs you have listened to more often by default)\n\n• Spoticentre - Centres the song/artist in now playing (Only working on some devices)\n\n\n\nNOTE\n\nThe ‘Car’ setting has been replaced with the sposify tweak settings so unfortunatley you cannot change car settings - all good tho, nobody use that shi anyways, and when car view enables when u in the car, just click ‘turn off car view’ at the top right corner.\n\n\nAll tweaks are injected by myself, WuXu, and ensured to be working perfectly ;)\n",
